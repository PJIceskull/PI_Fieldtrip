## Project Summary

For this project, my team and I will be creating a website based on Greek mythology. We thought that this would be a good topic for our websites since we can easily divide the pages for different gods, monsters, and heroes.

## Core Webpages

<!-- List core webpages and briefly describe the page of them. Include intractable features for the web app. -->

### Home

The home page will act as an introduction to the site. From updates about our newsletters, to briefly discussing the new web theme of the month. There will also be popular stories listed here, and a brief welcome at the top for any user that visits the site.

### About

The about page will discuss how the website came to be developed, as well as discuss the creators ambitions for the site and personalities briefly.

### News

This page will show The most recent or popular news articles that users can click on to read more information.

### Greek Gods

### Contact Form

As the heading suggests, this page will contain a contact form that users can filled to reach us. This form can be used for sharing share feedback and questions with the team.

### Featured Article

This page will feature a section about a random a Greek Hero, God/Goddess, or mythological legend depending on the month.

## Design Choices

<!-- List any websites that you might reference to influence your styling choices. List any colors used and what they were used for.

Describe your usage of tags and categories to help generate content on your pages. -->
